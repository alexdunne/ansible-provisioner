### Ansible provisioning roles ###

This is a collection of Ansible roles that can be used for provisioning web servers.

Many roles will work alone, but some need others to work. I'm afraid you'll have
to check that out yourself to see what's what. Soz!

Just create a base playbook and select each role you want to use.

Check the playbook.yml in the root of this project for an example usage.

Bug reports happily received.
