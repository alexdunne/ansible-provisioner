### Ansible provisioning roles ###

This is a collection of Ansible roles that can be used for provisioning web servers.

Each role should work alone or all together. That said, you should check each one
that it fits your needs.

Just create a base playbook andselect each role you want to use.

Check the playbook.yml in the root of this project for an example usage.

Bug reports happily received.
