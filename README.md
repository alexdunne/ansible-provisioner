### LNNM - Linux Node.js Nginx MongoDB ###

Basic provisioner to get you up and running for Node.js and MongoDB development.
You could use this for setting up for a MEAN stack, or whatever.
The Nginx might be a little overkill, but it at least shows how to set it up.

This should work well with Vagrant. My approach would be to add this as a
submodule to your project.
